# Don't Become the Queen/King of Over Scheduling

Going on vacation could go from a dream to a nightmare real quick. Its important to work with the time you have, and not to over schedule your activities and then wear yourself out the rest of the trip. I recommend 3 activities per day. 

Things you may need to consider to prepare for the activities may be: 

1. Time
2. Location
3. Weather
4. How much you're willing to spend
5. Activity restrictions

Before paying for activities and excursions, find a reasonable budget you are willing to spend for yourself or your family. Personally when I go on vacations I spend no more than $300, on activies and excursions. 

## **TIP OF THE DAY**
==Most of the time, booking activities online and in advance, are cheaper than booking at the activity site the day of. This is the same for [[Transportation|booking flights]]!!==
